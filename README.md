# Django For Beginners Chapter 4: Message Board

## What about the previous chapters?
I've done them in the past and didn't need to do it again. I was confused by all the Django stuff initially but after studying nodejs and playing around with all the various packages, I got a better understanding of web devlopment. I developed a preference for opinionated frameworks following some package dependency issues I had to face while using nodejs so I decided to learn Django and pick up where I left off.

## Description
A very simple message board that allows CRUD through the superadmin account

## New topic: Django ORM
ORM = Object Relational Mapper
Maps objects directly do database tables and allows easier database connection and data manipulation by the server(in other words: no need to directly write SQL queries).
Similar to typeORM and sequelize I used in nodejs so was easy to grasp.

## Tests
Testing to see whether creating a post actually creates a post
Testing to see whether calling routes gives a 200 response.
Testing to see whether the template used in the home.html template that is in the templates.
